# How to make the bot

## Which logic to Follow
1. As there is competition guidelines and lower time to finish we use PID logic
## Constraints
1. No weight constrains
2. The power supply should be on board
3. 12v Potential difference across every point
4. No rpm restriction
5. T junctions should pass
6. Other general
## Hardware Components To Use
- BG37 12v 300RP / 600RPM
- TB6612FNG(OR ANY HIGHER POWER MOTOR Use it with a heat sync)
- 25 x 25 x 25 cm Chassis constraints 
- 12v battery (Use lipo or 3.7v lithium with BMS)
